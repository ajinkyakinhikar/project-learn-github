I thought that's bad. That's why I have come up with an idea to put some shitty jokes in the space.

This is an open-source document. anyone can put their shitty jokes here. There's only one condition:

1. If Rajinikanth was born a hundred years earlier,
   the British would have fought to get their independence from India.
